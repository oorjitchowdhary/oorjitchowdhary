**Hi! I'm Oorjit,** a senior at University of Washington, Seattle from New Delhi, India.

I'm interested in building tech for public-interest systems, finance, user experience, or scientific research. At the moment, I'm actively interviewing for 2026 new grad roles - will be graduating with double degrees in Electrical & Computer Engineering and Economics and double minors in Data Science and Applied Math.

#### Previously, I was involved with:
- xAI/X in the core infrastructure team for two summers in Palo Alto and San Francisco.
- UW's [eScience Institute](https://escience.washington.edu) for designing cost-optimized, scalable cloud workflows for research computing.
- the UW Provost-led AI Task Force, helping execute University-wide AI enablement recommendations.
- [DubHacks](https://dubhacks.co), the largest collegiate hackathon in the Pacific Northwest, as the Tech Lead.
- [PM Association](https://www.instagram.com/uwpma), UW's official Product + Program + Project Management club, as the VP of Corporate Outreach.
- [HDFC Securities](https://www.hdfcsec.com), researching Gen AI product overhauls of online brokerage platforms in the context of Gen Z consumers.
- the MLH Fellowship, learning best practices in software engineering from industry professionals.
- and Google Code-in for technical contributions to [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org), an environment-focused open-source nonprofit.
